## 🏗️ Technology Architecture

### Frontend
- **Hono** - TypeScript web framework
- **Leaflet.js** - Interactive mapping (CDN)
- **Turf.js** - Spatial analysis (CDN)
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling (CDN)

### Backend
- **Cloudflare Workers** - Edge computing
- **Cloudflare D1** - SQLite database
- **Cloudflare Pages** - Static hosting

### Key Design Decision
**Use Turf.js for client-side spatial analysis** to work around Cloudflare D1's lack of PostGIS support. This provides:
- ✅ Zero server-side spatial database complexity
- ✅ Fast performance at the edge
- ✅ Lower costs (no PostGIS hosting)
- ✅ Simple deployment

## 🎯 Scoring Algorithm

Each site receives a score of 0-100 based on:

```
Overall Score = (GridCapacity × 30%) + 
                (TrafficFlows × 25%) + 
                (LogisticsProximity × 25%) + 
                (PlanningFeasibility × 20%)
```

**Interpretation:**
- 90-100: 🟢 Excellent (high priority)
- 75-89: 🔵 Good (recommend)
- 60-74: 🟡 Moderate (possible)
- 40-59: 🟠 Poor (not recommended)
- 0-39: 🔴 Unsuitable (exclude)
